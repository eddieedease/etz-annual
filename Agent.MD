We have an site with an anual report for an hospital. It is in Dutch, for the ETZ hospital.
We use angular and tailwind as library, there is no backend.
We already have an working system with two years (2024 and 2025)

For now, we have need to fill in the year 2025 (src->app->features->report-2025 component).

It is already filed with the the content of 2024 as a template, but we need to update it with the content of 2025.

I will provide you with the content of 2025 in a separate files, in word files is that okay? We do it per chapter. 

The colours for the etz are in the screenshot. I would like that all existing diagrams are updated with the new colours. But they can keep the same structuren (we just need to change the data that's in it). Also be sure to keep the page links the same, because we have a navigation panel on the left side of the screen that already works

Sounds like a plan?
